# Question_Answering_Model
Building and deploying self fine-tuned RoBERTa model
Utilized the SQUAD dataset for Question Answering system development. 
Performed data pre-processing including text normalization and tokenization. Integrated
RoBERTa model from huggingface and used it for QA tasks using
Pytorch. The model performance is assessed using EM and F1
score. The model is deployed with Gradio web application for seamless interaction for users.
